**I really need a way to synchronize startup scripts around all my laptops/workstations. Bash, zsh, vim...etc. So I created this.**

# Bash
* Bash aliases
* Environment variables
* And the .bashrc file

# Zsh
* Prompt and the color definition for it.
* And the .zshrc file.

_Since I have bash and zsh same time, I use only one environment setting script, so .bashenv may be required even if zsh is used alone._

# Vim
* The vimrc and all vim plugins under my home folder (.vim).
